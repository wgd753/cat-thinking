          <p>You know how cats can be mysterious sometimes? That's exactly why I created Cat Translator in 2024! As a cat parent myself, I wanted to build something cool that could help us all better understand what our cats are thinking. Thanks to Google's awesome Gemini AI model, that dream is now a reality!</p>
